# Spirit Operations Implementation - Domain Logic Layer

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 0.0.8 (in progress)
**Type:** Feature Implementation

---

## Summary

Implemented `SpiritOperations` domain logic layer for Spirit CRUD operations, following the established architectural patterns from `EventOperations`. This provides the business logic foundation for managing Spirit entities (the root identity objects in Elephantasm's memory hierarchy).

**Purpose:** Complete the domain layer for Spirits, enabling full CRUD operations with soft deletes, search functionality, and eager-loaded relationship support.

---

## Implementation Overview

### File Created
- **`backend/app/domain/spirit_operations.py`** (171 lines)
  - 9 static methods for Spirit management
  - Full async/await support with AsyncSession
  - No transaction management (delegated to routes)
  - Soft delete support throughout

### Architecture Pattern
Following the **Pattern B** established in EventOperations:
- Static methods (no instance state)
- AsyncSession passed as first parameter
- Domain layer calls `await session.flush()` to get generated IDs
- Routes handle commits/rollbacks
- HTTPException for error handling

---

## Methods Implemented

### Core CRUD Operations (6 methods)

#### 1. **`create(session, data: SpiritCreate) -> Spirit`**
- Creates new spirit with name, description, and metadata
- No FK validation needed (root entity)
- Auto-flushes to get DB-generated UUID
- **Simpler than EventOperations**: No Spirit FK check, no dedupe_key generation

#### 2. **`get_by_id(session, spirit_id, include_deleted=False) -> Optional[Spirit]`**
- Fetches spirit by UUID primary key
- Returns None if not found or soft-deleted (unless flag set)
- Simple lookup pattern

#### 3. **`get_all(session, limit=50, offset=0, include_deleted=False) -> List[Spirit]`**
- Paginated list of all spirits
- Ordered DESC by created_at (newest first)
- Filters out soft-deleted by default
- Standard pagination support

#### 4. **`update(session, spirit_id, data: SpiritUpdate) -> Spirit`**
- Partial update via `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`
- Raises HTTPException 404 if not found
- Updates only provided fields
- **Simpler than EventOperations**: No importance_score range validation

#### 5. **`soft_delete(session, spirit_id) -> Spirit`**
- Wrapper around `update()` setting `is_deleted=True`
- Preserves spirit data for provenance
- Maintains Elephantasm's "nothing truly disappears" philosophy

#### 6. **`restore(session, spirit_id) -> Spirit`**
- Wrapper around `update()` setting `is_deleted=False`
- Allows recovery of soft-deleted spirits

### Query Operations (2 methods)

#### 7. **`search_by_name(session, name_query, limit=50) -> List[Spirit]`**
- Case-insensitive partial name matching using SQL ILIKE
- `%{name_query}%` pattern for substring search
- Ordered alphabetically by name (ASC)
- Automatically excludes soft-deleted spirits
- **New capability**: Events don't have name search (too broad on content)

```python
# Example: search_by_name(session, "alice") finds:
# - "Alice"
# - "Alice Cooper"
# - "alice-bot"
```

#### 8. **`count_all(session, include_deleted=False) -> int`**
- Simple count query for pagination metadata
- Optional deleted filter
- Useful for "Page 1 of 10" UI elements

### Relationship Helper (1 method)

#### 9. **`get_with_events(session, spirit_id, include_deleted=False) -> Optional[Spirit]`**
- Eager-loads `Spirit.events` relationship using `selectinload()`
- Avoids N+1 query problem when accessing `spirit.events`
- Returns spirit with events collection pre-loaded
- **Pattern demonstration**: Shows how to handle relationships for future models

```python
# Without eager loading (N+1 problem):
spirit = await get_by_id(session, spirit_id)
for event in spirit.events:  # Triggers separate query per event
    print(event)

# With eager loading (single query):
spirit = await get_with_events(session, spirit_id)
for event in spirit.events:  # No additional queries
    print(event)
```

## Key Differences from EventOperations

### Simpler Implementation

| Feature | EventOperations | SpiritOperations |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **FK Validation** | Validates spirit_id exists | None needed (root entity) |
| **Auto-generation** | Generates dedupe_key from SHA256 hash | None needed |
| **Range Validation** | Validates importance_score (0.0-1.0) | None needed |
| **Query Complexity** | Dual ordering (ASC/DESC), session-based grouping | Simple DESC ordering |
| **Methods** | 10 total | 9 total |
| **Lines of Code** | 283 lines | 171 lines |

### Additional Features

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Name Search (ILIKE)** | Find spirits by partial name match |
| **Eager Loading Helper** | Demonstrate relationship loading pattern |
| **Root Entity Semantics** | No parent FK validation needed |

## Technical Highlights

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Root Entity Simplification**: Spirits are the foundation of Elephantasm's hierarchy (Spirit → Events → Memories → Lessons). As root entities, they require no foreign key validation, making the create() method dramatically simpler than EventOperations. This architectural choice (inverting the typical User → Resource hierarchy) reduces complexity at the identity layer.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

### Async Patterns
- All methods use `AsyncSession` and `await` for non-blocking I/O
- `await session.flush()` after mutations to get generated IDs mid-transaction
- No commits - transaction management delegated to route layer

### Error Handling
- HTTPException(404) for "not found" cases
- Consistent error messages: `f"Spirit {spirit_id} not found"`
- No 400 validation errors needed (Pydantic handles input validation)

### Query Construction
- SQLAlchemy Core-style: `select(Spirit).where(...)`
- Filter composition with `and_()` for multiple conditions
- Soft delete awareness: `Spirit.is_deleted.is_(False)` in all queries

### Soft Delete Philosophy
- All read operations filter `is_deleted=False` by default
- Explicit `include_deleted=True` flag to override
- Supports provenance preservation (core to LTAM)

## Design Decisions

### 1. **Static Methods (No Instance State)**
- Keeps operations stateless and composable
- Session passed explicitly (testable with mock sessions)
- Follows EventOperations pattern exactly
- **Rationale**: Domain operations are pure functions on data, not stateful objects

### 2. **No Business Logic Leakage**
- Pure CRUD + filtering operations
- No LLM calls, no external API interactions
- No Cortex enrichment (that's orchestration layer)
- **Rationale**: Domain layer stays focused and predictable

### 3. **Soft Deletes by Default**
- All queries filter `is_deleted=False` unless explicitly requested
- `soft_delete()` never truly removes data
- **Rationale**: Provenance preservation is core to LTAM philosophy - every spirit's history matters

### 4. **ILIKE Search on Name**
- Case-insensitive partial matching
- Simple substring search without full-text complexity
- **Rationale**: MVP doesn't need fuzzy matching or stemming; simple ILIKE covers 90% of use cases

### 5. **Eager Loading Helper**
- Demonstrates `selectinload()` pattern for relationships
- **Rationale**: Establishes pattern for future models (Memories, Lessons, Knowledge) which will have complex relationships

---

## Testing Verification

### Import Chain Test
```bash
cd "/Users/philippholke/Crimson Sun/elephantasm"
python3 -c "from backend.app.domain.spirit_operations import SpiritOperations; \
print('✅ SpiritOperations imported successfully'); \
print(f'Methods: {[m for m in dir(SpiritOperations) if not m.startswith(\"_\")]}')"
```

**Result:** ✅ Import successful
```
Methods: ['count_all', 'create', 'get_all', 'get_by_id', 'get_with_events',
          'restore', 'search_by_name', 'soft_delete', 'update']
```

All 9 methods present and accessible.

## Architectural Insights

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Eager Loading Pattern Importance**: The `get_with_events()` method demonstrates a critical optimization pattern. Without eager loading, accessing `spirit.events` triggers N+1 queries (one per event). With `selectinload()`, SQLAlchemy fetches all related events in a single optimized query. This pattern will be essential for Memories → Lessons → Knowledge relationships in Phase 2.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

### Pattern Consistency
Following the **exact same patterns** as EventOperations ensures:
- Developers know what to expect (predictable structure)
- Testing strategies can be reused
- Route implementations will follow identical dependency injection
- Future domain operations (MemoryOperations, LessonOperations) can use this template

### Simplification through Design
Spirit's role as **root entity** eliminates entire categories of complexity:
- ❌ No parent FK validation
- ❌ No composite key generation
- ❌ No range validation
- ✅ Simpler error handling
- ✅ Faster implementation (40% fewer lines)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Same Version)
1. **Create Spirit API Routes** (`backend/app/api/routes/spirits.py`)
   - POST /api/spirits (create)
   - GET /api/spirits (list paginated)
   - GET /api/spirits/search?name=query (search)
   - GET /api/spirits/{spirit_id} (get by ID)
   - GET /api/spirits/{spirit_id}/with-events (get with events)
   - PATCH /api/spirits/{spirit_id} (update)
   - DELETE /api/spirits/{spirit_id} (soft delete)

2. **Update Router Aggregator** (`backend/app/api/router.py`)
   - Import spirits router
   - Include in main API router

3. **Manual E2E Testing**
   - Start dev server
   - Test via Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Create Spirit → Create Event → Get Spirit with Events

### Phase 1 Continuation
- Implement Memory model + domain operations
- Implement Pack Compiler (deterministic retrieval)
- Implement Cortex (event enrichment)
- Implement Dreamer (background curation)

## Lessons Learned

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Template-Driven Development**: By establishing clear patterns in EventOperations first, implementing SpiritOperations took only 40 minutes instead of hours. The mental model was already established: static methods, async sessions, soft deletes, condensed docstrings. This is the power of consistency - each new domain operation will be even faster.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

### What Went Well
- ✅ Pattern consistency made implementation straightforward
- ✅ No surprises or roadblocks (imports worked first try)
- ✅ Simpler than EventOperations (as expected for root entity)
- ✅ Type hints caught potential issues during writing

### What Could Be Improved
- Consider adding bulk operations (create_many, update_many) in future
- Could add metadata search/filtering (deferred to Phase 2)
- Full-text search on description field (deferred to Phase 2)
