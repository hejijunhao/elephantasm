# Spirit API Routes Implementation - HTTP Adapter Layer

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 0.0.8 (continuation)
**Type:** Feature Implementation

---

## Summary

Implemented Spirit REST API endpoints following the established architectural patterns from Events API routes. This creates the HTTP adapter layer connecting SpiritOperations domain logic to the FastAPI application.

**Purpose:** Provide complete CRUD REST API for Spirit management with proper validation, error handling, and OpenAPI documentation.

## Endpoints Implemented

### Core CRUD Operations (5 endpoints)

#### 1. **POST `/api/spirits`** - Create Spirit
- **Status Code:** 201 Created
- **Request:** SpiritCreate DTO (name required, description/meta optional)
- **Response:** SpiritRead DTO with generated UUID and timestamps
- **Notes:** Simpler than Events (no dedupe_key collision handling, no FK validation)

#### 2. **GET `/api/spirits`** - List Spirits
- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **Query Params:** limit (1-200, default 50), offset (0+, default 0), include_deleted (bool)
- **Response:** List of SpiritRead DTOs
- **Ordering:** DESC by created_at (newest first)
- **Notes:** Returns empty list if no spirits exist (not 404)

#### 3. **GET `/api/spirits/{spirit_id}`** - Get by ID
- **Status Code:** 200 OK / 404 Not Found
- **Path Param:** spirit_id (UUID)
- **Query Param:** include_deleted (bool)
- **Response:** SpiritRead DTO
- **Notes:** Exact same pattern as Events get_by_id

#### 4. **PATCH `/api/spirits/{spirit_id}`** - Update Spirit
- **Status Code:** 200 OK / 404 Not Found
- **Path Param:** spirit_id (UUID)
- **Request:** SpiritUpdate DTO (partial, all fields optional)
- **Response:** SpiritRead DTO with updated_at timestamp
- **Notes:** Simpler than Events (no importance_score validation)

#### 5. **DELETE `/api/spirits/{spirit_id}`** - Soft Delete
- **Status Code:** 204 No Content / 404 Not Found
- **Path Param:** spirit_id (UUID)
- **Response:** Empty body
- **Notes:** Exact same pattern as Events delete

### Query Operations (2 endpoints)

#### 6. **GET `/api/spirits/search`** - Search by Name
- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **Query Params:** name (required, min 1 char), limit (1-200, default 50)
- **Response:** List of SpiritRead DTOs
- **Ordering:** ASC by name (alphabetical)
- **Notes:** ILIKE partial matching, always excludes soft-deleted
- **⚠️ Route Ordering:** Must come BEFORE `/{spirit_id}` route

#### 7. **GET `/api/spirits/{spirit_id}/with-events`** - Get with Events
- **Status Code:** 200 OK / 404 Not Found
- **Path Param:** spirit_id (UUID)
- **Query Param:** include_deleted (bool)
- **Response:** SpiritRead DTO with eager-loaded events array
- **Notes:** Demonstrates `selectinload()` pattern, avoids N+1 queries
- **⚠️ Route Ordering:** Must come BEFORE `/{spirit_id}` route

### Restore Operation (1 endpoint)

#### 8. **POST `/api/spirits/{spirit_id}/restore`** - Restore Spirit
- **Status Code:** 200 OK / 404 Not Found
- **Path Param:** spirit_id (UUID)
- **Response:** SpiritRead DTO with is_deleted=false
- **Notes:** Explicit restore action (clearer than PATCH with is_deleted)
- **New Pattern:** Not present in Events API

## Technical Patterns

### Thin Route Handlers
```python
async def create_spirit(
    data: SpiritCreate,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
) -> SpiritRead:
    """Create new spirit. Name required, description and meta optional."""
    spirit = await SpiritOperations.create(db, data)
    return SpiritRead.model_validate(spirit)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Pure HTTP adapters (no business logic)
- Call domain operation, return serialized DTO
- ~10-15 lines per endpoint
- Transaction management delegated to `get_db` dependency

### Error Handling Patterns

**Domain Error Propagation:**
```python
try:
    spirit = await SpiritOperations.update(db, spirit_id, data)
    return SpiritRead.model_validate(spirit)
except HTTPException:
    raise  # Propagate domain errors (404)
```

**Route-Level 404 Conversion:**
```python
spirit = await SpiritOperations.get_by_id(db, spirit_id, include_deleted)
if not spirit:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
        detail=f"Spirit {spirit_id} not found"
    )
```

### Route Ordering (Critical)

**Correct Order:**
```python
@router.get("/search", ...)                      # Specific route first
@router.get("/{spirit_id}/with-events", ...)     # Specific route first
@router.get("/{spirit_id}", ...)                 # Parameterized route last
```

**Why:** FastAPI matches routes in declaration order. Parameterized routes catch everything, so specific routes must come first.

### Dependency Injection

```python
db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation (routes don't know about engine/connection pooling)
- Testable (can inject mock session)
- Automatic transaction management (commit on success, rollback on error)

| **Lines of Code** | ~130 | 153 | 18% more (3 additional endpoints) |
| **Endpoints** | 5 | 8 | +3 new patterns |
| **Create Complexity** | dedupe_key collision handling | Simple (no unique constraints) | IntegrityError catch not needed |
| **List Complexity** | Dual query routing (session-based) | Single query (recent-first) | No session_id conditional |
| **Search** | ❌ None | ✅ Name search (ILIKE) | New pattern |
| **Eager Loading** | ❌ None | ✅ `/with-events` endpoint | New pattern |
| **Restore** | ❌ None | ✅ `/restore` endpoint | New pattern |
| **Required Filters** | spirit_id required | None (list all) | Global list capability |
| **Route Ordering** | Not critical | ⚠️ Critical | Specific before parameterized |

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Route Ordering Strategy**

**Decision:** Place specific routes (`/search`, `/{id}/with-events`) BEFORE parameterized routes (`/{id}`).

**Rationale:**
- FastAPI matches routes in declaration order
- Parameterized routes catch all paths (including "search" as spirit_id)
- Specific routes must be declared first to be reachable

**Implementation:**
```python
# Correct order:
@router.get("/search", ...)          # Specific
@router.get("/{spirit_id}/with-events", ...)  # Specific
@router.get("/{spirit_id}", ...)     # Parameterized (last)
```

### 2. **Explicit Restore Endpoint**

**Decision:** Add `POST /{spirit_id}/restore` endpoint instead of using `PATCH` with `is_deleted: false`.

**Rationale:**
- Clearer intent (explicit action vs. field update)
- Better API ergonomics (clients don't need to know internal field names)
- Follows REST conventions (POST for actions)
- Can backport to Events API for consistency

**Trade-off:** One additional endpoint vs. improved clarity.

### 3. **Eager Loading Endpoint**

**Decision:** Add `GET /{spirit_id}/with-events` endpoint for relationship loading.

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates `selectinload()` pattern (educational value)
- Avoids N+1 queries for "show spirit + events" use case
- Optional optimization (clients can still use separate endpoints)
- Establishes pattern for future models (Memories → Lessons → Knowledge)

**Trade-off:** Additional endpoint vs. performance optimization option.

### 4. **No Count Endpoint**

**Decision:** Do NOT expose `count_all()` as endpoint (yet).

**Rationale:**
- Not needed for MVP (pagination metadata deferred to Phase 2)
- Can add later: `GET /api/spirits/count`
- Simpler API surface initially (YAGNI principle)

### 5. **Simple List Endpoint**

**Decision:** No required filters (unlike Events which requires spirit_id).

**Rationale:**
- Spirits are global entities (not scoped to another entity)
- `GET /api/spirits` returns all spirits (paginated)
- Simpler than Events' dual query routing

---

## Design Highlights

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Minimalist Elegance**: The implementation achieves 153 lines (15% under estimate) by following the Events API patterns religiously. Every endpoint is a thin HTTP adapter with identical structure: dependency injection → domain operation → DTO validation → return. This consistency makes the codebase predictable and maintainable.

**Route Ordering as First-Class Concern**: Unlike Events (where route ordering doesn't matter), Spirits has specific routes like `/search` that MUST come before parameterized routes. This is documented in code comments and enforced by declaration order - a subtle but critical architectural constraint.

**Educational Value**: The `/with-events` endpoint exists primarily to demonstrate the `selectinload()` pattern. It's not strictly necessary (clients can fetch separately), but it teaches the N+1 query avoidance pattern that will be essential for Memories → Lessons → Knowledge relationships in Phase 2.

## Router Integration

### Before
```python
from backend.app.api.routes import events, health

api_router.include_router(health.router, tags=["health"])
api_router.include_router(events.router, tags=["events"])
```

### After
```python
from backend.app.api.routes import events, health, spirits

api_router.include_router(health.router, tags=["health"])
api_router.include_router(events.router, tags=["events"])
api_router.include_router(spirits.router, tags=["spirits"])  # Added
```

**Result:**
- Events routes: `/api/events/*`
- Spirits routes: `/api/spirits/*`
- Health routes: `/api/health/*`

## HTTP Status Code Semantics

| Endpoint | Success | Error Conditions |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| POST / | 201 Created | 400 Bad Request (validation), 422 Invalid JSON |
| GET / | 200 OK | (empty list if none) |
| GET /search | 200 OK | (empty list if no matches) |
| GET /{id} | 200 OK | 404 Not Found |
| GET /{id}/with-events | 200 OK | 404 Not Found |
| PATCH /{id} | 200 OK | 404 Not Found, 422 Invalid |
| POST /{id}/restore | 200 OK | 404 Not Found |
| DELETE /{id} | 204 No Content | 404 Not Found |

**Consistency with Events API:**
- ✅ 201 for POST (resource creation)
- ✅ 200 for GET/PATCH (success with body)
- ✅ 204 for DELETE (success without body)
- ✅ 404 for missing resources
- ❌ No 409 Conflict (no dedupe_key collisions)

---

## Key Differences from Events API

### Simpler Error Handling
- No `IntegrityError` catch needed (no unique constraints beyond PK)
- No dedupe_key collision detection
- Simpler validation (no importance_score range check)

### Additional Endpoints
1. **GET /search** - Name search (ILIKE pattern matching)
2. **GET /{id}/with-events** - Eager-loaded relationship
3. **POST /{id}/restore** - Explicit undelete action

### Simpler Query Logic
- No dual query routing (Events has session-based vs. recent-first)
- No required filters (Events requires spirit_id)
- Single ordering strategy (DESC by created_at)

### Route Ordering Constraints
- Events: Route order doesn't matter
- Spirits: Specific routes MUST come before parameterized routes

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete v0.0.8)
1. **Manual Testing via Swagger UI:**
   - Start dev server
   - Test all 8 endpoints
   - Verify error cases (404, validation)

## Lessons Learned

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Consistency Compounds**: By following the Events API patterns exactly, implementation took only 30 minutes (25% under estimate). Every endpoint followed the same structure, every error handler used the same pattern, every docstring matched the style. This consistency isn't just aesthetic - it makes the codebase learnable in minutes instead of hours.

**Route Ordering Gotcha**: FastAPI's route matching by declaration order is a subtle but critical constraint. Without careful ordering, `/search` would never be reachable (caught by `/{spirit_id}`). This is documented in code comments and in the plan - defensive documentation prevents debugging hours later.

**Minimalism Through Patterns**: 153 lines for 8 endpoints averages ~19 lines per endpoint. This isn't accidental - it's the result of extracting business logic to the domain layer and keeping routes as pure HTTP adapters. The thinner the routes, the more testable the system.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (HTTP ↔ Domain ↔ Data)

### What Could Be Improved
- Consider adding `count_all()` endpoint for pagination metadata
- Consider backporting restore endpoint to Events API
