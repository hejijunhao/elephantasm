1) What is an Event?

Atomic occurrence tied to a spirit (your owner/agent).

Has when it happened (occurred_at) vs when we saw it (received_at).

Has a kind (message, tool_call, tool_result, file_seen, decision, error, etc.).

Carries a normalized payload (human-readable text + minimal structured meta).

Is idempotent (dedupe key) and traceable (provenance pointer).

If you can point to it and say “that exact thing happened at that time,” it’s an Event.

2) How granular should Events be?

Use “meaningful atomics” as your rule:

Message = one Event (not the whole conversation).

Tool call = one Event; tool result = another Event.

File/document ingest = one Event per item.

User action / system decision = one Event each.

Errors = their own Event (they often produce lessons).

This makes downstream reasoning legible: a memory like “We tried X, it failed with Y” can link precisely to the tool_call + error events.

3) Threads / Conversations / Sessions—how do they fit?

Introduce one lightweight grouping handle and keep the rest derived:

session_id (or thread_id) on each Event:

If your source provides a conversation/thread ID (Slack, email, chat), map it here.

If not, you can derive sessions by inactivity windows (e.g., 30 minutes) and assign a generated session_id.

conversation is just a named/semantic view over sessions (optional in MVP). You don’t need a table—compute it if you must.

Events are the atoms; session_id is the simple glue that tells you “these belong together.”

4) Minimal Event taxonomy (start tiny)

Keep kinds to a handful; expand later:

message.in / message.out

tool.call / tool.result

file.ingested / doc.seen

decision (explicit choice, branch)

feedback (thumbs, rating, critique)

error (exceptions, failed calls)

note (freeform internal thought worth keeping)

5) What do Events store (conceptually)?

Identity: spirit_id (owner)

Clock: occurred_at (source time), received_at (ingest time)

Kind: from the taxonomy above

Session handle: session_id (external or derived)

Content: canonical text field (the “human legible” form)

Meta: small json blob (source app, tool name, latency, ids, tags)

Provenance: pointer(s) to where it came from (URI, message id, file hash)

Idempotency: dedupe_key (e.g., hash of normalized content + source id + occurred_at)

Importance hint (optional): quick 0–5 score set by the selector for triage

(You can index embeddings later; not required to be an Event.)

6) How do Events “lead” to Memories?

A selector scans recent Events (by session or time window) and fires triggers such as:

Novelty: “first time this fact seen”

Contradiction: conflicts with prior knowledge/memory

Outcome: a decision + result pairing

Repetition: same theme recurring

Feedback: explicit human signals

Emotion/Salience: strong sentiment or high impact

When a trigger fires, the selector composes a Memory:

Subjective summary (not chronological)

Links back to the precise Events (IDs)

Optional importance/confidence

Optionally seeds a Lesson (what/why/how/when) if the pattern merits it

7) Why not store conversations as Events?

Conversations are containers; Events are contents. Storing only conversations blurs granularity:

You lose precise links from a memory like “Tool choice X failed” to the specific call/result/error.

It’s harder to curate/promote lessons because the unit is too big and mixed.

8) Practical ingestion rules

Normalize at the door: turn any modality into: (kind, occurred_at, content, meta, session_id, provenance)

Keep it small & legible: prefer concise content over giant dumps; stash large blobs as artifacts elsewhere if needed and link.

Be idempotent: compute dedupe_key; drop if duplicate.

Separate clocks: never conflate occurred_at and received_at.

Tag lightly: a few tags in meta (e.g., topic: routing, tool: web_search) go a long way.

9) Storage & indexing (conceptual, not code)

Primary index: by spirit_id + occurred_at (DESC) → fast timelines

Session index: by spirit_id + session_id + occurred_at → fast thread views

Kind+time queries: by spirit_id + kind + occurred_at → quick filters

Dedupe lookup: dedupe_key unique per spirit

10) Retention & promotion (keep MVP simple)

Keep all Events for a reasonable horizon (e.g., 30–90 days).

Promote important signals into Memories and Lessons (durable).

Apply decay to Events first if you need to trim; Memories/Lessons persist longer.

11) Examples (to calibrate granularity)

A 6-message chat exchange with one tool call → 8 Events:

3 × message.in, 2 × message.out

1 × tool.call, 1 × tool.result, 1 × decision (“chose method B”)

A doc read that updates knowledge → 2–3 Events:

1 × doc.seen (with URI), maybe 1 × note (extracted fact), 1 × feedback if user marks it important.
